<h1>Market Inefficiencies</h1>
<small>February 9, 2025</small>
<br>
<br>
<p>
    I recently drove from Santa Barbara to Newport - normally a 2-hour drive on the 101 and the 405. However, I had the bright idea to leave at 1pm and so it took 4 hours.
    <br>
    <br>
    I drove in the leftmost lane because it’s usually the fastest. But as I inched forward, I noticed the lane to my right moving faster. I switched over and found myself indeed inching faster.
    
    Most drivers picked the left lane because like me, they assumed it would be the fastest. And then many of them stayed there by inertia, even as the circumstances changed.
    <br>
    <br>
    A traffic engineer might say drivers will eventually find the optimum. An economist might say the market will eventually be efficient.
    <br>
    <br>
    But it didn’t happen over a 100-mile stretch of the highway.  And if it didn’t happen in such a simple setting, it must not happen everywhere in life. I know circumstances are constantly changing - the hard part is knowing when to change lanes.
